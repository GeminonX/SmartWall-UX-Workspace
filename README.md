## Overview
SmartWall is a next-generation interactive workspace platform designed to enhance productivity and collaboration by offering large-display multipanels with draggable, resizable application windows. Developed as a team project at Texas Woman’s University for a user-centric UX design study, the system explores how smart walls can support dynamic workflows.

## My Role
- UX Engineering Lead on a 4-person team  
- Built the front-end prototype using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, including window management logic (drag, resize, snap)  
- Ran user interviews and conducted usability testing, resulting in a **~40% improvement in task flow efficiency** in simulation  
- Delivered documentation, prototypes, and iterative improvements throughout the semester

## Key Features
- Draggable and resizable interface panels  
- Multi-app workspace simulation on a single smart wall  
- Accessibility-aware design with keyboard navigation and screen-reader considerations  
- Responsive layout for different display configurations

## Technology Stack
- HTML • CSS • JavaScript  
- Wireframes and task-flow diagrams available in `/design`

## Demo
GIFs, screenshots and video walkthroughs are located in `/demo/screenshots`  

## Future Work
- Gesture-based input support  
- Real-time multi-user state synchronization  
- Integration with Vision-Language Models for enhanced user assistance
